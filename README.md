Some miscallaneous notes
Because other two repos got too cluttered with projects and notes from everywhere
At least notes here I will maintain cleany so that they are useful for me in future!

Paper short notes (summaries capturing the broad ideas without much technical detail, way for me to revisit so that the l1 cache instead of going into archive then being garbage collected off my brain):

- [cv/dinov3.md](https://github.com/Dd1235/research_fall25/blob/main/cv/dinov3.md) - Short notes on the key ideas from the DINOv3 paper.
- [cv/facet.md](https://github.com/Dd1235/research_fall25/blob/main/cv/facet.md) - Short notes reflecting the main insights from the FACET benchmark paper.
- [cv/lcm-lora.md](https://github.com/Dd1235/research_fall25/blob/main/cv/lcm-lora.md) - Short notes outlining the core ideas behind LCM LoRA distillation.
- [cv/mixtureOfNestedExperts.md](https://github.com/Dd1235/research_fall25/blob/main/cv/mixtureOfNestedExperts.md) - Short notes covering the Mixture of Nested Experts approach.
- [cv/perceptionLangauageModels.md](https://github.com/Dd1235/research_fall25/blob/main/cv/perceptionLangauageModels.md) - Short notes summarizing the perception-language models overview.

For my reference only:

- [general/vae.pdf](https://github.com/Dd1235/research_fall25/blob/main/general/vae.pdf) - this is just scribbles, not useful for anyone else
  about KL divergence, basically from me going off on all types of tangents instead of sticking to the topic i am studying
- [notes/dbscan.md](https://github.com/Dd1235/research_fall25/blob/main/notes/dbscan.md) - Short notes on the DBSCAN clustering algorithm.
- [cv/vit.pdf](https://github.com/Dd1235/research_fall25/blob/main/cv/vit.pdf) - Scribbles while learning about vit
