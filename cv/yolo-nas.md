# Foundational Object Detection Models — Accuracy vs. Latency Trade-Off

## Motivation

Object detection models must balance:

* **Accuracy** (mAP, AP50/95)
* **Latency** (real-time inference)
* **Hardware efficiency** (especially on edge / embedded devices)

Traditional architectures (e.g., Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLOv3/v4/v5) rely heavily on manual design — an iterative, heuristic process that’s:

*  **Tedious** (requires expert tuning)
* **Non-optimal** (not tailored to every hardware)
*  **Slow to adapt** (hardware & model co-design not automated)

Modern approaches like **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** and **Quantization-Aware Design (QAD)** solve this by **automatically discovering architectures** that are both accurate and hardware-efficient.

## Neural Architecture Search (NAS)

### Key Components of NAS

| Component                  | Description                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1️⃣ Search Space**        | Defines the possible network building blocks — convolution types, kernel sizes, activation functions, skip connections, depth, width, etc. |
| **2️⃣ Search Algorithm**    | Strategy to explore this space — reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms, gradient-based relaxation (DARTS), or random search.     |
| **3️⃣ Evaluation Strategy** | How architectures are scored — by accuracy, latency, FLOPs, or multi-objective cost functions (e.g., mAP vs. inference speed).             |

### Multi-Objective Optimization

To achieve the accuracy–latency balance, NAS optimizes:

$$
\max_\theta \ \text{mAP}(\theta) - \lambda \cdot \text{Latency}(\theta)
$$

where ( \lambda ) is a regularization coefficient that penalizes slow models.

## AutoNAC — Automated Neural Architecture Configuration

**AutoNAC** (used in **YOLO-NAS**, by Deci / Meta collaborations) automatically generates **hardware-aware** object detection architectures.

### Core Features

- Learns **data-dependent architectural patterns** (width, depth, activation mix).
- Optimizes for **specific hardware**, e.g. NVIDIA T4 GPU, Jetson, or CPUs.
- Produces architectures that **outperform manual YOLO variants** for the same latency budget.

### Hardware-Aware Search Objective

$$
\text{Score}(\theta) = \alpha \cdot \text{Accuracy}(\theta) - \beta \cdot \text{Latency}_H(\theta)
$$

where ( \text{Latency}\_H ) is measured on a target hardware profile ( H ) (e.g., TensorRT on NVIDIA T4).

This makes AutoNAC suitable for **edge deployment** and **server optimization** simultaneously.

## Quantization-Aware Architectures (QAA)

Real-time detection systems often operate on **edge devices** (e.g. drones, IoT cameras) with limited memory and compute power.

### Principle

- **Quantization** compresses weights and activations from 32-bit floating point (FP32) to lower precision formats like INT8:

  $$
  w_{\text{int8}} = \text{round}!\left( \frac{w_{\text{fp32}}}{s} \right)
  $$

  where (s) is the scaling factor mapping float values to integer range ([-127, 127]).

- This reduces model size **by 4×** and boosts inference speed **2–4×**, but may degrade accuracy.

### Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)

During training, quantization effects are simulated to preserve accuracy:

- Insert fake quantization ops into training graph.
- Train end-to-end with quantized activations to adapt weights.

## QARepVGG — Quantization-Aware RepVGG Backbone

**QARepVGG** (Quantization-Aware RepVGG) is an **improved RepVGG** backbone adapted for **object detection under INT8 quantization**.

### Key Improvements

| Aspect                | RepVGG                                      | QARepVGG                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Block Design**      | Structural re-parameterization at inference | Adds quantization calibration layers     |
| **Quantization Drop** | ~3–5% mAP drop                              | ≤1% drop                                 |
| **Latency**           | Moderate                                    | Lower (optimized tensor layout)          |
| **Compatibility**     | Generic CNNs                                | Optimized for detection heads (YOLO/SSD) |

**RepVGG recap:**

- Converts multi-branch Conv-BN blocks (used during training) into **a single equivalent convolution** during inference:
  $$
  y = (W_1 + W_2) * x + (b_1 + b_2)
  $$
  → enables pure sequential convolution for **high GPU throughput**.

**QARepVGG adds quantization constraints** in re-parameterization to retain accuracy after weight rounding.

  - **Neck:** PAN-FPN for multi-scale feature aggregation
  - **Head:** Decoupled detection heads (separate cls/reg branches)

- Tuned for **TensorRT** runtime (NVIDIA T4), **ONNX**, and **OpenVINO**.

### Observations

- **Better accuracy–latency trade-off:** NAS discovers bottleneck-free blocks that human designers might miss.
- **Native quantization support:** QARepVGG backbone ensures minimal accuracy loss post-INT8 conversion.
- **Plug-and-play deployability:** Direct TensorRT / OpenVINO export with full quantized weights.

## Deployment and Fine-Tuning

Typical workflow:

1. Start from two pretrained YOLO-NAS checkpoints (e.g., “medium” and “large”).
2. Fine-tune on your dataset (COCO-style or custom).
3. Convert to INT8 using **QAT or post-training quantization (PTQ)**.
4. Export to **ONNX → TensorRT** for real-time inference.

Result:

- Same or higher mAP than YOLOv8 with **~30–40% less latency**.
- Optimized memory and FLOPs for specific GPU/CPU targets.
